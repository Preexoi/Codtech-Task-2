DESCRIPTION:
This code measures temperature and simulates humidity using an Arduino. Here's a brief explanation:

1. Temperature Measurement:
   - The code reads an analog value from a sensor connected to pin A0.
   - This value is converted into millivolts (Voltage), which is then used to calculate the temperature in Celsius (tempC).
   - The temperature is further converted into Fahrenheit (tempF).
   - The results, including raw sensor data, voltage, and temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, are printed to the Serial Monitor.

2. Humidity Simulation:
   - Humidity is simulated using a potentiometer connected to pin A1.
   - The potentiometer's analog value is mapped to a percentage range (10% to 70%).
   - This simulated humidity value is printed to the Serial Monitor.

3. Loop:
   - The loop() function repeats every 5 seconds, continuously updating and printing the temperature and humidity readings.

CODE:
This code records the temperature through testing the mV put out by the sensor.
It records in both Celcius and Fahrenheit. 
It can only detect from -40 degrees C to 125 degrees C or -40 degrees F 
to 257 degrees F
The Humidity is simulated by a potentiometer by being mapped into percentages
